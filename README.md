# Vetha_Meet_Video_Chat_App
Meet Video Chat Web Application Project for the Microsoft Engage Mentorship 2021 submission.
Working of the Web App:
1. app.js is the front end. When we click on any button or functionality in the User Interface, it will call the respective function from the back end which is the chatserver.py.
2. The back end code framework is created using Flask which is a python framework.
3. This web application uses Twilio for the implementation of the video calling feature.
4. The application asks for the audio and video permissions from the user and the name the user wants to be displayed for their video.
5. On sharing the same link with other people, they would be able to join the call as well and the same process continues and the users could communicate with one another.
